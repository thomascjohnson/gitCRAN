\title{gitCRAN: A package for keeping your internal/custom CRAN repo in a git
provider like Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc.}
\section{Concept}{

Creating and maintaining a custom/internal CRAN repository requires setting
up a file server and a way of adding/removing packages, as well as updating
the PACKAGES file that registers the available packages.

Furthermore, a simple file server lacks any version control, history, etc.
By taking advantage of a git repository and git repository viewer, a CRAN
repo can be created, browsed, rolled-back, access controlled, etc.
}

\section{Usage}{

The usage of this package is currently limited and based on usage with
Github, though there is the ability to use it with Bitbucket and Gitlab,
though it isn't tested (and I'm not sure if it will work at all).

What you need:
\enumerate{
  \item A repository on Github (or Bitbucket, or Gitlab)
  \item A personal access token from the git provider that can read/write
  \item An R package that you'd like to add to the repository
}

What's optional:
\describe{
  \item{type}{Setting the repository type - this is essentially whether to
  compile the package as a binary or as source. The default is "source",
  which will not compile the package as a binary and simple run the package
  build step. If not "source", then specify the directory you want to group
  the binaries under. For example, suppose you want to build a binary
  package for Centos 7 (and you're running this on Centos 7), then the type
  could be "centos7" and the result would be a binary package under
  /centos7/src/contrib/.}
  \item{branch}{The branch of the repository you want to write to.}
}

An example would then be:
\itemize{
  \item repo: github.com/thomascjohnson/testCRAN
  \item package: github.com/thomascjohnson/gitCRAN (this package)
  \item branch: master
  \item type: source
  \item token: My Github PAT
}

And the actual code:
\preformatted{
  add_package(
    "github.com/thomascjohnson/testCRAN",
    "github.com/thomascjohnson/gitCRAN",
    branch = "dev",
    type = "cflinuxfs3",
    token = my_github_pat
  )
}

Alternatively, you can set your PATs with \link{set_token} and omit the
token parameter (it will pull the token automatically).
}
